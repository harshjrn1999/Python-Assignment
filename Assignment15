Q Please write a program using generator to print the numbers which can be divisible by 5 and 7 between 0 and n in comma separated form while n is input by console.

def task1(n):

  for i in range(n+1):

    if i%5 == 0 and i%7 == 0:

      yield str(i)
      
print(','.join([i for i in task1(100)]))

0,35,70

Q Please write a program using generator to print the even numbers between 0 and n in comma separated form while n is input by console.

Q Define a class named Shape and its subclass Square. The Square class has an init function which takes a length as argument. Both classes have a area function which can print the area of the shape where Shape's area is 0 by default.

class Shape:

  def __init__(self,length):
    self.length = length

  def area(self):
    return 0

class Square(Shape):

  def area(self):
    return self.length*self.length

shape_obj = Shape(10)
shape_obj.area()

square_obj = Square(13)
square_obj.area()
